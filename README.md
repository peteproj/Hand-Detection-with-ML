# Hand-Detection-with-ML

In this contains a folder with the code to use an arducam with a raspberry pi to open an app that opens a camera preview and detects a hand gesture that you will set when you train your ML model using google Teachable Machine and capture the frame of the camera preview once the program is confident that your gesture is detected.

## OBJECTIVES:
- Create a "simple‚Äù game of Rock Paper Scissors using machine learning
- Learn how data sets are utilized to create a ML algorithm
- Set up a camera module on the Raspberry Pi

## SUPPLIES:
- 1x Raspberry Pi
- 1x camera module with appropriate cable
