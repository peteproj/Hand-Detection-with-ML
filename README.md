# Hand-Detection-with-ML

In this contains a folder with the code to use an arducam with a raspberry pi to open an app that opens a camera preview and detects a hand gesture that you will set when you train your ML model using google Teachable Machine and capture the frame of the camera preview once the program is confident that your gesture is detected.
